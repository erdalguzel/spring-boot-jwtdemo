This is a simple project to demonstrate JSON Web Token(JWT) based authentication with Spring Boot 3. You can use a command-line tool like cURL, httpie or with Postman. I also wrote several unit tests with JUnit 5 to ensure that code is working as intended. I dropped screenshots to demonstrate API testing. Hope this code helps.
